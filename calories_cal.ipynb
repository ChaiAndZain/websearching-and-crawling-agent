This common yet significant part of Indian cuisine offers more than just energy but varies greatly depending on ingredients and preparation methods.\\nCommonly used Roti’s and their approx Calories\\nType of RotiCalories per Serving (approx)Chapati104Roti106Paratha280Nan262Kulcha145Jowar88 Calories in Different Quantities and Types TypeServingCaloriesRoti1106Roti2212Roti3318Roti4424Roti5530Roti6636Roti7742Roti8848Roti9954Roti101060Roti121272Roti151590Roti202120Roti with Ghee1126Roti with Ghee2252Roti with Ghee3378Roti with Ghee4504Roti with Ghee5630Roti with Ghee6756Chapati2208Chapati3312Chapati4416Chapati5520Chapati6624Chapati8832Homemade Roti (without oil)1 serving85\\nCalories in Different Types of Rotis\\nType of RotiServing SizeCalories per Serving (approx)Ragi Roti1 roti102 caloriesNachni Roti1 roti108 caloriesMakki Ki Roti1 roti112 caloriesTandoori Roti (without butter)1 roti160 caloriesBajra Roti (with ghee)1 roti150 caloriesRumali Roti1 roti78 caloriesMultigrain Roti1 roti120 caloriesMissi Roti (with ghee)1 roti130 caloriesAtta Roti1 roti104 caloriesBesan Roti1 roti110 caloriesMaida Roti1 roti114 caloriesBarley Roti1 roti99 caloriesCorn Roti1 roti85 caloriesMethi Roti1 roti90 caloriesPhulka Roti1 roti71 caloriesRice Flour Roti1 roti120 caloriesRajgira Roti1 roti94 caloriesDal Roti1 roti130 caloriesButter Roti1 roti150 caloriesBran Roti1 roti80 caloriesWheat Flour Roti1 roti104 caloriesRice Roti1 roti130 caloriesNaan Roti1 roti137 calories\\nPlease note that the calorie counts are approximate and can vary based on the recipe, size of the roti, and specific ingredients used.\\nType of Roti/ChapatiApproximate Calories per ServingChoker Roti80-110Dhalpuri Roti Skin200-250Almond Flour Roti150-200Jaggery Roti120-180Jamaican Roti200-300Roti KingVaries based on typeKothu Roti350-400Khasta Roti100-150Kenyan Chapati110-160Sri Lankan Roti100-150Lentil Roti120-170Meethi Roti150-200Roti Naan130-190Roti Paratha200-250Roti Planta150-200Pol Roti100-150Palak Roti120-170Quinoa Roti90-140Rava Roti90-140Rajma Roti130-180Chicken Chapati Roll200-300Roti Skin80-120Roti Sardin200-250Sooji Roti80-130Sukha Roti70-100Sorghum Roti90-140Spinach Roti120-170Trinidad Roti200-250Tawa Roti Wheat100-150Thai Roti250-300Kashmiri Roti120-180Chawal Ki Roti (Rice Roti)80-120Small Roti60-80Medium Roti80-110Large Roti120-160Tandoori Roti with Butter150-200Aloo Roti (Potato Roti)150-200Buckwheat Roti100-150Double Roti200-250 (depends on size)Flour Roti80-120Oats Roti without Wheat90-140Paneer Roti150-200Ragi Roti without Oil80-120Rice Chapati80-120Whole Wheat Roti80-110White Roti100-140Roti Curry150-250 (varies with curry)Roti with Peanut Butter250-300 (depends on spread)Corn Flour Roti90-130Millet Roti90-140Roti per 100g300-350 (average)Amaranth Roti90-130Afghani Roti120-170Beetroot Roti100-150Chana Roti (Chickpea Flour)120-170Coconut Roti150-200\\nFrequently Asked Questions\\nHow many calories does 1 Roti have?\\nThe calorie content of one roti varies depending on the ingredients and size. A standard medium-sized whole wheat roti typically contains about 80-110 calories.\\nHow many calories in a Maida Roti?\\nMaida (refined flour) roti usually has slightly more calories than whole wheat roti, averaging around 100-140 calories per medium-sized piece, depending on its size and thickness.\\nIs Roti better than rice?\\nBoth roti (especially when made from whole grains like whole wheat) and rice have their own nutritional benefits. Roti is generally higher in fiber and nutrients if made from whole wheat, while rice is easier to digest and may be better for those with digestive issues. The choice between roti and rice depends on individual dietary needs and preferences.\\nWhich is healthier: paratha or roti?\\nRegular roti is generally healthier than paratha. Roti, especially when made from whole grains, is lower in calories and fat. Parathas often contain added fats like ghee or oil and sometimes stuffing, which increases their calorie content.\\nIs maida or atta better for weight loss?\\nAtta (whole wheat flour) is generally better for weight loss than maida (refined flour). Whole wheat flour has more fiber, which can help in feeling fuller for longer and can aid in better digestion and metabolic health.\\nHow many rotis to eat for weight loss?\\nThe number of rotis suitable for weight loss varies depending on individual calorie needs, which are influenced by factors like age, sex, weight, height, and physical activity levels. Generally, portion control and balancing rotis with a healthy mix of vegetables, protein, and healthy fats is key.\\nHow many roti should I eat?\\nThe appropriate number of rotis in a meal depends on your total daily calorie needs and the rest of your diet. It’s typically recommended to include a balanced portion of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats in each meal.\\nIs roti good or bad for weight loss?\\nRoti can be part of a weight loss diet if consumed in moderation. Opting for rotis made from whole grains and balancing them with vegetables, lean protein, and healthy fats can create a nutritious and satisfying meal that supports weight loss.\\nAre Rotis and Chapati the same?\\nRoti and chapati are terms that are often used interchangeably, but they can have subtle differences depending on the region and context.\\n1. Roti: This is a generic term used in many parts of South Asia to refer to any type of flatbread. Roti is usually made from whole wheat flour (atta) and water, and sometimes salt. It is typically unleavened and cooked on a flat pan. Rotis can be soft or crisp, thin or thick, depending on how they’re prepared.\\n2. Chapati: Chapati is a type of roti, specifically a thin, unleavened flatbread, commonly eaten in India. Like roti, it is typically made from whole wheat flour, water, and sometimes a bit of salt. The dough is rolled into flat discs and cooked on a hot pan until it puffs up. Chapatis are known for being soft and fluffy.\\nIn many parts of India and in general conversation, the terms ‘roti’ and ‘chapati’ are used synonymously to describe the same type of bread. However, in some regional cuisines, ‘roti’ might refer to a broader range of breads that could include varieties made from different flours or with additional ingredients.

Image Credit: Abhichat Anukulwech / EyeEm/EyeEm/GettyImages Roti is a flatbread made with three ingredients and popular in many Asian countries, including India and Pakistan. Roti nutrition and the calories in roti can vary based on family recipes and differences in manufacturing. Advertisement Tip According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), there are 297 calories in a 100-gram serving, or about 3.5 ounces, of plain roti. This can vary considerably, though. Video of the Day Roti Nutrition Facts The calories in roti can vary based on what it is made with. The USDA indicates that a single piece of plain roti weighing 68 grams offers 202 calories, while a 100-gram serving offers 297. However, it does not specify what that hypothetical roti is made of, in terms of ingredients. Other varieties of roti listed have different calorie counts. Video of the Day For example, another USDA listing for \"bread, chappatti or roti (Indian bread), wheat\" indicates that 100 grams of roti has 299 calories. An 8-inch, or 52-gram piece has 155 calories. Ultimately, the difference comes down to slight variations in manufacturers and what they put in their roti.

Here’s Everything You Need to Know Traditionally roti is made with crushed atta flour from semi-hard durum wheat, a variety of wheat typically used to make pasta. Since atta comes from wheat, you should avoid roti or look for gluten-free varieties if you have gluten sensitivity. The other traditional ingredients are water and oil.\\nRead more: The Health Benefits of Semolina\\nSome recipes or store-bought roti may include ingredients like salt or other flavor enhancers. For example, according to the USDA, the Royal Wine Corporation makes Couscous Roasted Garlic Ail roti. This roti contains wheat flour and water, but it also contains sugar, salt, dehydrated garlic and other seasonings. There are 350 calories in 100 grams of this brand of roti. Advertisement Roti offers a variety of potent nutrients. For example, according to the USDA some, non-whole-wheat varieties contain more than 7 grams of protein, while one whole-wheat variety has over 11 grams of protein in a 100-gram serving. All varieties of roti that the USDA reviewed contain over 9 grams of dietary fiber, and each variety is high in nutrients like calcium, potassium and phosphorus.\\nWe Recommend Nutrition Are All Beans Gluten-Free? Nutrition 20 Scary-Sounding Food Additives That Are Actually Harmless Nutrition Ready to Track Your Macros? Here’s Everything You Need to Know Carbohydrates in Roti The total carbs in roti are relatively high, but most varieties have a good amount of dietary fiber. According to the USDA, total carbs in roti range from around 46 net grams to 75 net grams. Net grams represent the total amount of carbohydrates, minus the dietary fiber provided by the food.

According to the USDA, dietary fiber totals range from around 2.5 grams to nearly 10 grams in a 100-gram serving. Whole-grain varieties have more dietary fiber, so you should check for whole grain roti if you are looking to increase your dietary fiber intake. Advertisement According to the Food and Drug Administration, most Americans are not getting enough dietary fiber. The recommended amount is 25 grams, per day, based on a 2,000-calorie diet.\\nDietary fiber can provide you with several health benefits. According to the University of California, dietary fiber can help make you feel full sooner. Also, fiber can slow the rate at which your body absorbs sugar, which can help prevent blood sugar spikes. Dietary fiber can both help keep you regular and help clean out your intestines.
