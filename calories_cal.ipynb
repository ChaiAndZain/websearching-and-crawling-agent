The USDA indicates that a single piece of plain roti weighing 68 grams offers 202 calories, while a 100-gram serving offers 297. However, it does not specify what that hypothetical roti is made of, in terms of ingredients. Other varieties of roti listed have different calorie counts. Video of the Day For example, another USDA listing for \"bread, chappatti or roti (Indian bread), wheat\" indicates that 100 grams of roti has 299 calories. An 8-inch, or 52-gram piece has 155 calories. Ultimately, the difference comes down to slight variations in manufacturers and what they put in their roti.
